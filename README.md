# Remember Code Block Language

Ever find yourself typing the same language name over and over when creating code blocks? This plugin remembers the last language you used and automatically suggests it the next time you create a code block.

Just start typing a code block (```) and it'll automatically insert your last used language. You can also set a default language in settings if you tend to use one language more than others.

## Features

- Automatically remembers your last used code block language
- Auto-injects the language when you type a code block (can be disabled in settings)
- Command to insert a code block with the remembered language
- Customizable default language

## Installation

Install from the Community Plugins browser in Obsidian, or manually install by copying `main.js`, `manifest.json` to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/remember-code-block-lang/` folder.
